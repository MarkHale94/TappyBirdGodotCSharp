# Tappy Plane

> Tappy Plane is a Flappy Bird Clone following along the Udemy Course: [Jumpstart to 2D Game Development: Godot 4 for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/jumpstart-to-2d-game-development-godot-4-for-beginners/) by Richard Albert. The course itself is written using GdScript, this particular follow along is my attempt at creating the game using C# instead. All assets used in the creation of this game are free to use and the credit is given in the course.
